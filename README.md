## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Jenkins**
   Follow the official Jenkins installation guide to set up Jenkins on your server or local machine.

3. **Configure Jenkins**
   - Install necessary plugins such as Git, Pipeline, and any AWS-related plugins.
   - Create a new pipeline job and point it to the `Jenkinsfile` in this repository.

4. **AWS Configuration**
   - Ensure you have an AWS account and the necessary permissions to deploy resources.
   - Configure your AWS credentials in Jenkins using the Credentials plugin.

5. **Deployment Script**
   - Modify the `deploy/scripts/deploy.sh` script as needed to fit your deployment requirements (e.g., deploying to EC2 or S3).

## Usage Guidelines
